# Network Server

## How it came to be

First we've created a website with html, js and css which we would use as our frontend. Subsequently we've created an API which stood in for the transportation of our payload. For this we needed to execute the following two commands in the terminal: `npm init` and `npm install express ...`.

## Starting the project

To start the API enter the command `npm start` in its respective folder.

Then you can also start the frontend in its respective folder as you would start any other website you've created.
